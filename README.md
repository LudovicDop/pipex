# PIPEX

This program reproduces the same behavior as the shell command pipe.

Real command syntax : 

``` < file1 cmd1 | cmd2 > file2```

Simulation of pipe : 

```./pipex file1 cmd1 cmd2 file2 ```

How to compiled my project :

- "make all" (compiles the project)
- "make clean" (removes all .o files from the compilation)
- "make fclean" (removes all compiled files)
- "make re" (cleans and recompiles my project)
